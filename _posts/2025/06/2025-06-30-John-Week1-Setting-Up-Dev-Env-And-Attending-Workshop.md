### Project Overiew

This project involes using understand and improving READY, an open-source framework for real-time AI-enabled nystagmus diagnosis. This a disease characterised by rhythmical, repetitive, and involuntary movement of the eyes.

### Highlights

- Almost completed setting up my developer environment. This included installing uv and creating my virtual environment, verifying everything is okay by running some bash scrips, and importing my personal tmux and neovim configs from my GitHub page.
- I've also started to read papers on UNET, one of the models used in this project, to improve my theoretical understanding of the project.
- On 2025-06-27, I volunteered at the "Healing Through Collaboration: Open-Source Software in Surgical, Biomedical, and AI Technologies", a full-day workshop that was part of
The Hamlyn Symposium on Medical Robotics 2025. It was wonderful hearing the exciting research the speakers presented.

### Early Challenges

- Initially, I was going to set up my developer environment on Windows. However, since I was more familiar with Linux, I decided on installing WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). This meant I could run bash and git commands in a single window, as well as use my tmux and neovim configs that I use on my personal machine. 
- After installing cmake since it was a dependecy for the project, an error kept popping up after I tried to install the onnxsim package via uv.

### Next Week's Plan
- Continue improving my understanding of model architecture used in the project.
- Find a solution as to why I can't install the onnxsim package.
