### What is my project about?

I am building a machine learning model that predicts errors, and using these to optimise quantum circuits.

### Why use Quantum Computers, and what problems exist?

* Quantum computers promise revolutionary speedups due to quantum mechanical effects, however its reliability is limited by noisy hardware. My project aims to use AI to increase efficiency and error-awareness in Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, prior to Quantum Error Correction (QEC).

### Overall Goal

* Develop an AI-enhanced quantum circuit optimiser.
* Predict the effects of quantum noise (qubit decoherence, quantum gate and measurement errors)
* Recommend optimisations to improve the efficiency of quantum circuits.

### Tasks completed this week

| Task                                                                                                                         | Checklist |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------:|
| Restructured the codebase and cleaned project files | ✔        |
| Reproduced previously lost files and data | ✔        |
| Improved my Simulated Annealing file more consistent in detecting errors (with 100% fidelity)
this was however lost and am still attempting to reproduce fully (currently sometimes does not optimise whatsoever)| ✔        |
| Created tester circuits to iteratively check that each Gate Rule is correct | ✔        |



### Next week’s plan

* Fully reproduce the Simulated Annealing file + extend gate logic
* Return back to Reinforcement Learning policy file / resolve problem with reward function
